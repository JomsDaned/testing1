<b> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is Animal Cruelty?</b>

<p class="border-box">
  Animal cruelty is when people hurt animals or don’t take care of them properly. 
  This can mean hitting them, not giving them food or water, or leaving them in bad
   places where they are not safe. Sometimes people are mean to animals on purpose, 
   like for fun or to make money. Other times, it happens because they don’t know how to 
   take care of animals the right way.
  
  Animal cruelty is bad because animals can feel pain, sadness, and fear, just like us.
   Animals deserve love, care, and a safe home. When we understand what animal cruelty is,
    we can work together to stop it and help animals be happy and safe.

<b> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How can we prevent this?</b>

<p class="padding-box"> We can stop animal cruelty by being nice and taking care of animals. First, we need to make sure our pets have enough food, water, and a safe place to stay. If we see an animal that is hurt or in danger, we should tell an adult or call someone who can help, like an animal rescue.

  It’s also important to teach other kids how to be kind to animals. We should not support places that hurt animals, like some circuses or pet stores that treat animals badly. We can also adopt pets from shelters instead of buying them.
  
  Laws help too! We can ask our leaders to make strong rules to protect animals. Even little things, like feeding a stray cat or helping a bird in trouble, can make a big difference. If we all work together, we can stop animal cruelty and keep animals safe and happy. </center> </p>
